### Overview

My website is my virtual business card, a place to show off projects I think are cool as well as hone my computer science skills.

#### Climbing

I am an avid climber. I also love data and analytics. I have logged all the climbs I have done in the past decade or so so this presented a beautiful opportunity to work with some cool data visualizations in the browser. I host my website statically on Netlify, so even though all the clibing data is pulled from 8a.nu I must run an update script to pull the data and commit the generate JSON files to my GitHub. Future plans will include a fully functional back end as well as the ability to pull data directly from 8a. Here is tthe analysis of my climbing: https://david.vaskos.com/climbing/analytics/david-vasko


#### Portfolio

This section of my website has many of my college projects reworked to work within my website. I am particulairly proud of the WebGL projects and enjoyed making them website ready. One of the coolest is: https://david.vaskos.com/webgl/galaxy
